<div class="panel">
  <p>Great question, it's both! We designed Hey Lets Code to take your camper off your busy hands for the majority of the work day. Our mixed cirriculum balances out education and fun in order to keep your camper engaged the whole 5 hours. 
    <br>
    We also offer hour long sessions daily for two weeks to accommodate to every student's learning patterns.</p>
</div>                       
-->
                        <button class="accordion">What class do you recommend for my student?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If this is your student's first coding class, regardless of age, we recommend our Scratch class to learn fundamentals of programming. If your student has previous knowledge of programming, we recommend the Web Development and Python class.
    <br>
      <br>
      If your student is interested in Game Design / Video Games we recommend Scratch and Roblox Game Development!
    </p>
</div>
         
<button class="accordion">What will my student be learning in the Scratch class?</button>                 
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this class your student will learn the basics of programming including how to write instructions for a machine, simple data structures, programming logic (conditionals, loops, variables), and exciting applications of scratch such as games and movies.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What will my student be learning in the Web Development class?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this class your student will learn how to construct a user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They will learn the power of creating a website and gain experience with methodology used in industry today.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What will my student be learning in the Roblox Game Development class?</button>                 
<div class="panel">

<div class="panel">
  <p>In this class your student will be learning the fundamentals of Python scripting through logic, loops, data structures, and much more. The project will either be a visual program or text-based game.

</div>
                        
<button class="accordion">How will you keep my student engaged?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>It is inherently more difficult to keep students focused on a virtual class with nobody else in the room, so we have games and engagement strategies specifically designed to keep our campers engaged online for the full 2 hours. Many of our games involve physical movement, breaking up the monotony of sitting in front of a screen, or visual perception, keeping the student's attention on the class. </p>
</div>
                        
                        <button class="accordion">Is there a referral system?</button>
